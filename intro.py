#How videogames work

#Movies > Videogames
#Movies - Lots of images that are shown in quick succession (+sound)

#video games - both just show you lots of images and your brain interprets thats as a fluid motion

#movies
#  - are fixed
#  - No way to input(except pausing and fastforwarding)
#game 
# - images are dynamically generated while game is running  - position of enemies, player movement and health etc changes all the time
# - constant checking of player input to update what frame is being drawn

#CONCEPT

#1. Checking player input(the event loop)
#2. Use that information to place elements on the screen\
#----------------------V------------------------
#                   it creates images ________________________++

#2D games > places images on the screen.
#3D games places 3D models on the screen.
#Both of theme can produce image(frames)

#HOW PYGAME WORKS/PURPOSE

#1*Pygame helps you draw images(and play sounds)

#2*Check for player inputs.(input() stops your code and is thus useless for games)

#3* other gamedev tolls like collisions, creating text, timer etc

#----------------------------------- BAD NEWS -----------------------

# Pygame is always just for the beginer 

# Game engines: programmers that help you make games by giving you tools like level editors, physics engines, skeleton animations(and much more) to make games

--> # making games in pygame > you solve a ton of problems yourself and become a good programmer in general > you can quickly learn a new game engine or other tools
